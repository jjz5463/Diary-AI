    example_1 = 'A garden comes to life as a kaleidoscope of butterflies flutters amidst the blossoms, their delicate wings casting shadows on the petals below. In the background, a grand fountain cascades water with a gentle splendor, its rhythmic sound providing a soothing backdrop. Beneath the cool shade of a mature tree, a solitary wooden chair invites solitude and reflection, its smooth surface worn by the touch of countless visitors seeking a moment of tranquility in nature\'s embrace.'
    example_2 = 'A small boy, head bowed and determination etched on his face, sprints through the torrential downpour as lightning crackles and thunder rumbles in the distance. The relentless rain pounds the ground, creating a chaotic dance of water droplets that mirror the dramatic sky\'s anger. In the far background, the silhouette of a cozy home beckons, a faint beacon of safety and warmth amidst the fierce weather. The scene is one of perseverance and the unyielding spirit of a child braving the elements.'
    example_3 = 'A suited astronaut, with the red dust of Mars clinging to their boots, reaches out to shake hands with an alien being, their skin a shimmering blue, under the pink-tinged sky of the fourth planet. In the background, a sleek silver rocket, a beacon of human ingenuity, stands tall, its engines powered down, as the two representatives of different worlds exchange a historic greeting amidst the desolate beauty of the Martian landscape.'
    example_4 = 'An elderly gentleman, with a serene expression, sits at the water\'s edge, a steaming cup of tea by his side. He is engrossed in his artwork, brush in hand, as he renders an oil painting on a canvas that\'s propped up against a small, weathered table. The sea breeze whispers through his silver hair, gently billowing his loose-fitting white shirt, while the salty air adds an intangible element to his masterpiece in progress. The scene is one of tranquility and inspiration, with the artist\'s canvas capturing the vibrant hues of the setting sun reflecting off the tranquil sea.'
    example_5 = 'A golden retriever, sporting sleek black sunglasses, with its lengthy fur flowing in the breeze, sprints playfully across a rooftop terrace, recently refreshed by a light rain. The scene unfolds from a distance, the dog\'s energetic bounds growing larger as it approaches the camera, its tail wagging with unrestrained joy, while droplets of water glisten on the concrete behind it. The overcast sky provides a dramatic backdrop, emphasizing the vibrant golden coat of the canine as it dashes towards the viewer.'
